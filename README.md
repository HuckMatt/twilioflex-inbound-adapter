# Sample-Demo-Components

Use this Github repository as a reference guide to building custom applications using Rammer APIs. In this repo you'll find sample component integrations that are complete from end to end, but rather, can be used to plug and play within your own application flows.

Feel free to fork any of the projects here to use on your own and if you have any code improvements, make a pull request and the request will be reviewed by one of our admins.
